  - [Luvit API Documentation](/api/)
  - [Example Luvit Apps](https://github.com/luvit/luvit/tree/master/examples)

 - Functions with similiar names may have more detailed explanations in the Nodejs docs.  
  - [Node.js API](https://nodejs.org/api/)

 - Reading source code is always fun!  
  - [Luvit on Github](https://github.com/luvit/luvit/blob/master/README.markdown)

 - Luvit also comes with a package manager, similiar to npm.  
  - [Lit Wiki](https://github.com/luvit/lit/wiki/Creating-Your-First-Package)
  - [Luvit Invention Toolkit](https://github.com/luvit/lit/blob/master/README.md)

 - LibUV bindings for lua. Will work without luvit. Luvit wraps a lot of functionality from it.   
  - [Luv API](https://github.com/luvit/luv/blob/master/docs.md)

 - Luv with conventions. The base for making standalone executables.  
  - [Luvi Docs](https://github.com/luvit/luvi/blob/master/README.md)
